# Estimation of monocular depth using CNN

## Introduction

Our model is based on similar work [Towards Good Practice for CNN-Based Monocular Depth Estimation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/papers/Fang_Towards_Good_Practice_for_CNN-Based_Monocular_Depth_Estimation_WACV_2020_paper.pdf). Our aim was to recreate given research on NYUv2 labeled dataset containing 1449 pictures.
